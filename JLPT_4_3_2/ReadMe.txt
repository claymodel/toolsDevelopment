JLPT Vocabulary files

The JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Tests) have four levels; levels 4 (beginner) and 3 (advanced beginner) correspond roughly to the first two semesters of college level language study, and levels 2 and 1 are more advanced. More information about these tests can be found (among other places) at :

The files in this zip file are in CSV format, which can be imported by Version 1.60 of WaKan (please remember to select CSV in the "Files of type" dropdown of the Import dialog).

At the lower levels, the tests only require you to know hiragana spellings for some vocabulary words; for these words, the spelling is given in hiragana even when there is also a kanji spelling (which you can find using the dictionary). When a definition begins with an asterisk (*), it means that the word itself occurred in a lower level test, but the kanji spelling did not; so it is a "new" vocabulary word at the higher level of the test only in that knowing the kanji spelling is now required.
