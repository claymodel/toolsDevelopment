    Open $APP_HOME/conf/server.xml
    Edit the conf/server.xml file in one of the copies in the following way:
    Change the port on the root Server element to a different number (e.g. 8006)
    Change the port attributes on the Connector elements to a different number (e.g. 8010 instead of 8009, 8081 instead of 8080 and 8444 instead of 8443)
    Change Port Addresses
        Connector Port
        Shutdown Port
        AJP Connector Port
        Redirect Port

a.Connector Port

This is the port where Apache Tomcat listen for the HTTP requests. By default this port is set to 8080. We can identify this Port inside server.xml by checking the following tag. Change the port to different value (for example 8081) and the second instance will listen the HTTP request on that port.
<connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
 connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" />
b.Shutdown Port

This port is used when we try to shutdown the Apache Tomcat Server. We can identify this Port inside server.xml by checking the following tag.
<server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
</server>
c.AJP (Apache JServ Protocol) Connector Port

The Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) is a binary protocol that can conduct inbound requests from a web server through to an application server that sits behind the web server. We can identify this Port inside server.xml by checking the following tag.
<connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" />
d.Redirect Port

Any redirection happening inside Apache Tomcat will happen through this port. In Apache TOMCAT there are two instance where redirectPort is mentioned. First one is for the Apache TOMCAT server and other one is for the AJP port. We can identify this Port inside server.xml by checking the following tag. Ensure that redirectPort should be same for AJP and HTTP protocol.
<connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" />
<connector port="8100" protocol="HTTP/1.1" connectionTimeout="20000" redirectPort="8443" />
