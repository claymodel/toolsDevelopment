# == Synopsis
#   This is a script to test and demonstrate my YRKShellScript helper class
#
# == Usage
#   shell-script [options] arg1
#
# == Examples
#   Run normally:
#     $ shell-script
#
#   Show each command it executes:
#     $ shell-script --verbose
#
#   Show the commands it would execute, but don't actually execute:
#     $ shell-script --test
#
#   Show commands and other debugging output:
#     $ shell-script --debug

# Define a method to be called by an option
# NOTE: you have to pass script as an arg if you want to do script.echo or script.cmd, etc.
def printEs(script)
  script.echo "EEEEE"
end

# Add additional options
script.add_options do
  # NOTE: The code you run in one of these blocks gets run immediately (before even the option are finished parsing), so be careful.  I usually just set a flag or value in the script.opts OpenStruct, which is used later in the body of the script.  Also note that if you call a method here (such as #printEs) you have to pass script as an arg in order to have access to it there (for doing script.echo or script.cmd, etc.).

    script.opts.date = val

# to override the defaults from yrk-shell-script-helper.rb

# Do argument validation
# raise OptionParser::InvalidArgument or OptionParser::MissingArgument
# (with an optional message) if args aren't valid or missing (respectively)
script.check_arguments do
  script.echo "Checking if args are valid"
  if script.opts.debug
    script.echo "there are #{script.arguments.length} args (not including options)"
  end

  script.echo "overriding an option"
  script.opts.show_errors = true
  
  if script.arguments.length == 0
    raise OptionParser::MissingArgument, "Need at least 1 argument"
  end

# Here is the body of the script
script.run do

  # * they print out their title in green, with extra line-breaks
  # * also, if you do ctrl-C during the script, it just ends that section

  # To get the output of a command, use the #cmd_output method
  # This is just a convenience method for calling #cmd with :capture_output => true

  # print any output to the console (when you pass :show_cmd_output => true) until
  # the entire command has finished.

  # There is a helper to get user input
  # Right now it just accepts single-character responses, but it does have an
  # optional timeout, in which case it uses the default response (which, by convention is the
  # first one listed in the array of accepted responses)
