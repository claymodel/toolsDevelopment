vi /etc/init.d/jira433
#!/bin/sh
#chkconfig: 345 99 10
#description: Jira433 auto start-stop script.
 
case "$1" in
start)
echo -n "Starting jira4.3.3"
 
/usr/local/atlassian/jira433/bin/start-jira.sh &
;;
stop)
echo -n "Shutting down jira4.3.3"
echo -n " "
/usr/local/atlassian/jira433/bin/stop-jira.sh &
 
;;
restart)

## running or not, start it again.
$0 stop
$0 start
