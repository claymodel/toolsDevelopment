What to use when? It depends on your topology.

In case you already have or need Apache 2.2 functionality you have the choice to choose between mod_proxy and mod_jk.

Mod_jk works very well on Apache 2.2, so it all depends on the functionality needed:

mod_proxy

    Pros:

      No need for a separate module compilation and maintenance. mod_proxy, mod_proxy_http, mod_proxy_ajp and mod_proxy_balancer comes as part of standard Apache 2.2+ distribution
      Ability to use http https or AJP protocols, even within the same balancer.

    Cons:

      mod_proxy_ajp does not support large 8K+ packet sizes.
      Basic load balancer
      Does not support Domain model clustering

mod_jk

    Pros:

      Advanced load balancer
      Advanced node failure detection
      Support for large AJP packet sizes

    Cons:

      Need to build and maintain a separate module
