Cassandra has Map Reduce support which is pretty new. You will need a hadoop cluster to run it.

Data will be tranferred from Cassandra cluster to the hadoop cluster. Not suitable for running large data map reduce jobs.    

In HDFS Map Reduce support is native. HBase is built on Hadoop. Data does not get transferred.

Comparatively simpler to maintain if you don't have to have Hadoop.

Comparatively complicated as you have it has many moving pieces such as Zookeeper, Hadoop and HBase itself.

No master server, hence no single point of failure.

Although there exists a concept of a master server, HBase itself does not depend on it heavily. HBase cluster can keep serving data even if the master goes

down. Hadoop namenode is a single point of failure.
